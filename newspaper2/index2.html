        <h2>Gurugram’s power demand up 20% this summer</h2>
        <p id="divp2">Gurgaon: Electricity demand in the city has increased by about 20% this summer compared to the same period last year.</p>
        <p>Power department officials say they are struggling to meet demand amid scarce coal reserves at state power plants and the state’s problems with private electricity purchases. As a result, various parts of the city have been struggling with power outages over the past few months. Officials said they had forecast an annual increase in electricity demand of about 8-9%. The spike caught them off guard.</p>
        <p>In keeping with the trend, electricity demand in Gurgaon started to increase from April and peaked around July. But this year, March registered a 29% increase in demand – 1,316MW compared to 1,020MW in 2021.</p>
        <p>April was no different, as the city requested 1,671MW compared to last year’s 1,292MW. In May, demand was 1,680MW compared to 1,007MW in 2021. Also in June, electricity demand was 1,735MW compared to 1,466MW in the same month last year. Officials believe demand could surpass 1,900 MW this July – 1,750 MW last year.</p>
        <p>In terms of consumption, too, the trend is similar. Gurgaon sold 300,000 units in April compared to 250,000 units last year. In May, the consumption was 335 thousand units compared to 204 thousand units in 2021. In June, the average consumption increased to 360,000 units compared to 273 thousand units in the same month last year.</p>

        <h2>Here's what India needs for a systematic plastic waste recycling</h2>
        <p id="div2p2">Plastics are everywhere- it is one of the biggest threats looming over the world's environmental well-being. Global plastic waste generation has more than doubled from 2000 to 2019 to 359 million tonnes. India has been a consistent contributor to adding plastic waste to these numbers.</p>
        <p>According to Union Cabinet Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change Bhupender Yadav, India generates 3.5 million tonnes of plastic waste annually. The prolonged pandemic and the burst of retail spaces such as FMCG markets, e-commerce, and food delivery services have seen an upward growth in plastic consumption.</p>
        <h5>Recycling – the need of the hour</h5>
        <p>In 2021, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted – 'Plastic per se is not a problem; it is uncollected plastic waste that is.' The tweet highlights an important issue, that plastic which can't be recycled goes unmanaged. According to the Central Pollution Control Board report 2019-2020, India recycles around 60% of plastic waste. The remaining 40% ends up in landfills, on the streets, clogging water bodies, etc. Unmanaged plastic also makes its way into the bellies of grazing animals, making it a concerning nuisance. This undisposed plastic is leading to a major plastic crisis.</p>
        <p>We as a country also struggle to do proper documentation of plastic recycling.</p>
